4.	Reflection
The challenges I faced with this project were creating the Kanban Template. Since it was
my first experience with it, I did not know how to navigate around it. I quickly learnt
my way through it and saw how to use it. It is a very useful tool and has a lot of benefits, as
stated in point 3. Creating it the second time around will be much, much simpler.
Compared to Jira, Kanban is very flexible, and is the most suitable for this Agile project.
Kanban is also the easier one to learn between the two.
