**4\. Reflection**

This assignment allowed me to gain a more clearer perspective on my assignment as whole. It assisted me in defining the key workflow activities/actions for each stakeholder, and refine my UML modelling for systems. It also reminded me of how to model Activity Diagrams and State Transition diagrams, as UML diagrams and their syntaxes are very similar so confusing them is easy. I also learnt the importance/uses of each of the two types of diagrams (**State Transition, Activity Diagram**). The UML modelling helped me define and refine the roles for each user/stakeholder.
