3.	A Kanban board is a tool used for project planning. You can declare/define your project tasks and set their priority level.
It allows you to place your tasks in their relative statuses, and allows you to sort and view them based on their status.
You can put them in a roadmap to visualize the workflow, time and dependency aspect of the tasks.

The Kanban board helps team members see where all tasks are with regards to their status. 
It limits bottlenecks by not allowing tasks to be ‘work in progress’ as such tasks limit continuous development and delivery.
The status column shows you the task is in progress, in review, ready, not started and complete. It supports Agile principles 
by bettering the efficiency of the workflow, allowing statuses to be clearly visible to the team. 
It promotes CI/CD by organizing all tasks, in turn increasing customer feedback and satisfaction.
The Kanban allows team members to collaborate efficiently by making all work tasks and statuses transparent, increasing work productivity.
