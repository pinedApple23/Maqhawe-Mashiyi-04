Repository Layer Design Justifications

?? Use of a Generic Repository Interface I created a base Repository interface using a class that defines common CRUD operations: save, findById, findAll, and delete. This allows us to:
Enforce a consistent API across all entity-specific repositories (e.g., User, JobPost, Application)

Promote code reusability and minimize duplication

Lay the groundwork for easily switching or extending storage backends

ÔøΩUsed a generic base class to avoid duplicating CRUD logic across multiple repositories.ÔøΩ

?? In-Memory Implementation with Map I used JavaScriptÔøΩs built-in Map object to simulate a HashMap-based in-memory data store. This implementation is ideal for development and testing because:
It provides fast O(1) access for CRUD operations

It allows unit tests to run without needing a real database

It simplifies debugging and prototyping

? ÔøΩUsed in-memory storage for fast prototyping and unit testing, with no external dependencies.ÔøΩ

Entity-Specific Repositories Each domain entity (User, JobPost, Application) has its own repository class that extends the generic Repository. This allows us to:
Add specialized query methods later (e.g., findByEmail, findByCompany)

Keep the logic for each entity modular and easy to maintain

? ÔøΩCreated separate repositories per entity to support future domain-specific logic.ÔøΩ

Swappable Storage Backends The repositories are designed to be storage-agnostic. In-memory versions are implemented now, but future versions (e.g., using file storage, SQL, or MongoDB) can easily replace them. This will be managed using a Factory Pattern or Dependency Injection in future iterations.

Factory Pattern Justification The Factory Pattern was used to dynamically select between different repository implementations, ensuring clean separation of concerns and easy future extensibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ÔøΩ Creational Design Patterns
This repository demonstrates the use of all six creational design patterns using JavaScript, tailored to a Job Portal System. Each pattern is implemented with a relevant and practical use case to show how it fits into the real-world architecture of such a system.

? Patterns Implemented
1. Simple Factory
Use Case: Creating different types of job applications (Internship or Full-Time).

Justification:
This pattern is used to centralize object creation logic and encapsulate the instantiation of job applications. Prevents code duplication, and makes it easy to add new application types in the future.

2. Factory Method
Use Case: Creating notification objects (Email or SMS).

Justification:
Each type of notification has its own implementation, so the Factory Method pattern allows the system to defer the decision of which subclass to instantiate. This promotes flexibility and separation of concerns.

3. Abstract Factory
Use Case: Creating families of UI components (Menu and Dashboard) for different user roles (Applicant or HR).

Justification:
Ensures that all UI components created for a particular user role are consistent. Helps manage related objects together and makes it easier to support multiple user experiences across the platform.

4. Builder
Use Case: Constructing a complex JobPost object step by step with optional fields.

Justification:
A job post can have optional attributes such as salary, benefits, and closing date. Using Builder makes it easier to create readable and maintainable code when building such complex objects with optional parameters.

5. Prototype
Use Case: Cloning job post templates.

Justification:
Useful when multiple similar job posts need to be created. Instead of building from scratch every time, we clone an existing template and modify only whatÔøΩs needed. This improves performance and consistency.

6. Singleton
Use Case: Managing a single instance of a database connection.

Justification:
Ensures that the app uses only one database connection instance, which conserves resources and prevents connection conflicts across the system.

Testing & Coverage
This project uses Jest for unit testing and code coverage. See test directory for tests. See coverage directory for test and coverage information.

Stakeholder Identification Roles:
Applicant Role ‚Äì Explore job vacancies and find relevant posts. Apply to relevant job posts by entering their information including ID, Resume, supporting documents. Receive feedback on their job application via contact details. Utilize Interview Prep page and its resources.

HR Personnel Role - The HR Personnel views the various applications and vets out the necessary/relevant candidates.

Site Administrator Role ‚Äì The site admin‚Äôs main tasks are managing the applications that are on the website. They make sure the vacancies have all the necessary and correct information, and make sure the job posts are not visible past the closing dates. They should also make sure the Interview Prep content stays updated and relevant in order for it to be useful to the applicant.

IT Support IT Support assists with all infrastructure and network issues pertaining to the website.

Systems Developers The System/Software developers will design, develop and maintain the codebase of the portal. All features that need to be developed or updated will be the developers‚Äô responsibility.

Compliance Officer The compliance officer ensures the vetting and hiring of new employees goes according to law and recruitment standards. They ensure laws put in place are being adhered to.

Key Concerns:

Applicant The portal‚Äôs user interface needs to be user friendly, comprehensible and intuitive. The applicant should clearly see the listed posts and the relevant information on the vacancy, and be able to enter and submit their data onto the portal. The Interview Preparation section should be comprehensible and concise to the Applicant. All external sources for Interview Prep should be accessible.

Recruitment Agency/HR Personnel The screening process should allow for a shorter vetting process of applications. An ATS (Application Tracking System) tool should be made use of when looking for the perfect candidate, saving time and effort, increasing accuracy.

Site Administrator The site administrator should have ease of access to uploading tools, editing tools and job current jobs vacancies that need to be filled. They should be kept in close communication with the recruiters as to be informed about job-listings.

IT Support IT Support focuses on ensuring system uptime, security, and performance through proactive monitoring and quick troubleshooting. They manage backups, data recovery, and integrations while providing user support. Their priorities include resolving technical issues, maintaining system integrity, and collaborating with administrators and developers to ensure smooth operations.

System Developers System need efficient development tools, clear requirements, and efficient testing environments to build, integrate, and maintain the system. Their priorities include ensuring code quality, optimizing system performance, and implementing new features. They focus on collaboration with other teams and ensuring system scalability and security during development and deployment.

Compliance Officers The Compliance Officer ensures the Job Application and hiring process adheres to legal and regulatory standards, particularly regarding data protection and privacy laws. They prioritize monitoring system practices for compliance with relevant regulations. Their role includes conducting audits, managing risk assessments, and ensuring the organization follows ethical hiring practices.
