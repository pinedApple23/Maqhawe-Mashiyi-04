Project Title: Job Submission Portal with Interview Preparation Support

Domain: Employment


Problem Statement: 
Many job applicants face difficulties in preparing for interviews after submitting their applications. 
There is a need for a system that not only facilitates the job application process but also provides interview preparation resources and tips to ensure applicants are fully prepared for the interviews they attend. 
This lack of integrated support often leaves applicants underprepared, impacting their performance in interviews and their chances of success.

Individual Scope/Feasibility Justification: While most job portals focus solely on job listings and resume submissions, this website has a interview preparation section. This additional feature provides a competitive edge by offering 
personalized and comprehensive interview preparation. By offering resources like interview tips, commonly asked questions, and even mock interview scenarios, the system ensures applicants are better equipped to succeed. 
This not only enhances the user experience but also increases the likelihood of successful job placements, making the system more attractive to both applicants and employers.
