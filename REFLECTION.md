# Reflections

Contributing to and collaborating on an open-source project through GitHub was a valuable experience. One of the main obstacles I faced during this assignment was the timing of repository sharing among peers. Since many peers shared their GitHub repositories quite late, this significantly reduced the available time for meaningful collaboration, peer contributions, and engagement.
We had limited opportunities to explore projects, understand its structure, and actually contribute because of time. In real open-source projects, early visibility and active promotion are critical to attracting contributors, and I now realize how important timing and accessibility are in collaborative environments. While there was enough time to gather stars, deeply exploring the projects needs you to
do an in depth analysis. 

Despite these challenges, the process taught me the importance of preparing my repository as if contributors could arrive at any moment. 
The presence of well-documented setup instructions, clearly labeled issues, and a defined roadmap proved to be very helpful. I learned that collaboration is not just about inviting others to contribute. It's also about ensuring that everything they
need to get started is already in place. In future projects, Iâ€™ll prioritize timely sharing, clearer communication, and ongoing engagement to foster better collaboration. The experience has also added to my appreciation for open-source maintainers who successfully manage contributor communities, and I now feel better equipped to play that role myself.
