1.	Template Analysis and Selection     
                               
Comparison Table between 3 Github Project Templates.

|                    | Columns and Workflows|Automation Features|Suitability|
|Kanban Board	       |          Y		        |       Y		        |    Y	    |
|Project Roadmap	   |          N	          |       Y		        |    Y	    |
|Team Planning Board |	        Y	          |       N	          |    N      |


Comparison Justifications
The best template pick of the three is the Kanban Board.
The Kanban Board ticks all the boxes. It has more Columns and Workflows, all Automation
Features and is the most suitable for this Agile project. The Project Roadmap has 
fewer columns and workflows, has a few automation features and would not be very suitable 
for my agile project. The Team Planning Board has some columns and workflows, very few 
automation features and would not be at all suitable for creating a project as it does not 
have the necessary automation features that would be most suitable for this project.
